				<h2>Name Assignment</h2>
				<p>
						<img src="images/nameassignment.jpg" width="400" height="300"/>
					</p>
					<h2>Description: </h2>
					<p> Use scratch to design and create a program that shows my name. The requirements were to add a sprite for each letter in my name and give them 3 unique behaviors. The program needed to run when the green flag was clicked and for extra credit I added a function to eset the scene to the beginning each time the green flag was clicked.
					</p>
					<h2>Concepts Learned:</h2>
					<ul>
							<li>Using event blocks- green flag clicked, when key pressed</li>
							<li>Conditional statements- used if statements to control when and when things happen</li>
							<li>Used loops- I used a forever block to continue the cycle of the letters moving, I used the repeal until block to stop the movement on command.</li>
							<li>Sprites- I created my own sprites using the sprite editor, I used the library of sprites to find letters in my name and adjusted the costumes, in order to make it look more aesthetic.</li>
							<li>Movement- I used the x and y values to make my sprites move to their original location when the green flag was clicked I rotated the sprites to different locations using the directions of coordinates as my guide.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h2>Computer Buying Project</h2>
					<p>
					<img src="images/computerbuyingproject.jpe" width="400" height="300"/>
					</p>
					<h2>Description:</h2>
					<p>We used scratch in order to make a presentation in order to compare computer and demonstrate the pros and cons of them in order to fit a person's certain needs. The goal of the project was to pick a computer based the needs of the person that we interviewed . The entire presentation had to be made of scratch and compare the 4 computers and the pros and cons of each.
					</p>
					<h2> Concepts Learned:</h2>
					<ul>
							<li> Green flag- I used the green flag to switch costumes and summon other sprites</li>
							<li>Broadcast- I used broadcast to put sprites in motion, activate words, bringing in of new sprites, increase Sprite size, and to move a Sprite in certain ways.</li>
							<li>Repeat/ if statements- I used the repeat and if statements to continue programming and to stop it if another event occurs.</li>
							</ul>
							
							<h2> Final Scratch Project</h2>
							<p>
							<img src="images/finalscratchproject.jpg" width="400" height"300"/>
							</p>
							<h2>Description:</h2>
							<p>We used scratch to combine all of the skills that we used into one game or story that exemplifies all of the scratch programming we have picked up. I made a pong game using different programming variables along with control variables, data variables, etc. This game was designed to serve as a real life pig game where if you hit the edge you get a point and once you receive a certain amount of points you win. Out of all three levels whoever won two games of five points first would win.
							</p>
							<h2> Concepts Learned:</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>I used the data variables to show what score the players had.</li>
								<li>I used score you keep track of the score of each player.</li>
								<li>I used timer to keep track of how long the game has been going on.</li>
								<li>I used the green flag to reset each level.</li>
								<li>I used broadcast to broadcast the background to change between each level.</li>
								<ul>
