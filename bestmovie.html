		<h1>THE HANGOVER</h1>
			<p>My favorite movie is the Hangover. This is my favorite because I love the concept and the story line is so great. The actors in the movie are so funny and just make you believe everything is real. My favorite actor in The Hangover is Zach Galifianakid, because everything he says is super weird and funny and he tries to make the best out of the worst situation.</p>
