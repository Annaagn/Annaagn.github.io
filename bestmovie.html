		<h2>Why I like the movie</h2>
			<p>My favorite movie is the Hangover. This is my favorite because I love the concept and the story line is so great.</p>
		<h2> Favorite actor</h2>
			<p>My favorite actor is Zach Galifianakis, because he helps the plot come to life. Everything he says is super funny and just an element to the movie that they would not have had without him.</h2>
